## Motivation

The inspiration for this repository came from a moment when a friend recommended the song *"Either, Or: On Off the Drugs"* by JPEGMAFIA. Even as I write this, I’m listening to *"Gangsta"* by Karan Aujla. That’s when I realized—my music preferences transcend specific artists or genres. There's something unique about the music I enjoy, though I can’t yet fully define it.

This repository aims to address that very curiosity. Its purpose is to serve as a centralized platform for developing better music recommendation systems to facilitate music discovery, making it easier for others to explore diverse and personalized music collections.
